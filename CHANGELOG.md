## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- ❓ **Native Mirrored Interactive Question Prompts & Grill-Me Support** — Full mirror and interaction support for Antigravity's `ask_question` tool and `/grill-me` design sessions:
  - Preserves interactive question containers (`data-testid^="interaction-"`) from snapshot stripping during DOM cleanup.
  - Mirrored chat view renders option pills directly on mobile with instant optimistic tap feedback.
  - High-contrast visual highlight: 1.5px accent border, glowing ambient background (`var(--accent-soft)`), illuminated option ID badges (`A1`, `A2`, `1`, `2`) in bold white on accent background, and subtle unselected styling.
  - Stable switching UX (zero rubber-banding): suppressed synthetic duplicate click events on `<input>` elements, debounced snapshot reloads, and implemented an `activeUserOptionKey` grace period in `loadSnapshot()` preventing in-flight stale desktop snapshots from reverting selections.
  - Multi-step questionnaire support with dynamic "Continue ↵" vs "Submit ↵" buttons and write-in input field handling.
- ⚡ **Gemini Antigravity CDP Support & Lexical Editor Staging** — Backported from Kelvin Tan's fork ([@kelverssg](https://github.com/kelverssg)):
  - Local HTTPS Gemini Antigravity CDP target discovery via URL patterns in `src/cdp/connection.js`.
  - Multi-window target enumeration across ports supporting Gemini page targets alongside classic workbench targets.
  - Lexical editor injection (`[data-lexical-editor="true"]`, `[aria-label="Message input"]`) with Shadow DOM `composed: true` event dispatching.
  - Input boundary staging verification ensuring messages are registered in Lexical/Preact state before triggering submission.
  - Multi-tab fallback scanner (`injectMessageAnyTab`) across ports when primary editor is unfocused.
- 🔒 **Concurrency Serialization & Message Deduplication**:
  - Global atomic Promise-chain lock (`withSendLock`) preventing overlapping mutations inside the editor.
  - Fail-safe Express error handling returning HTTP 500 cleanly without hanging callers on unexpected rejections.
  - SHA-256 message deduplication with 120-second suppression window (`SEND_DEDUPE_MS = 120_000`) protecting against automated retry loops.
  - Busy retry backoff loop (`[1000, 2000, 4000]` ms) on `/send`.
- 🎙️ **Native Voice Memos** — In-browser audio recording directly from the mobile composer with live waveform/timer visualization, supporting `audio/webm` (Opus), `audio/mp4`, and `audio/wav`. Uploads to `POST /api/upload-audio` and injects directly into the Antigravity prompt for Gemini multimodal audio processing.
- 📋 **Interactive Plan & Action Decision Remote System** — Remote support for Antigravity's Planning Mode artifacts (`implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`). Provides interactive action cards for plans, command approvals, and design questions.
- 🗂️ **Mobile Plan Preview Modal & Review Drawer** — Full mobile markdown preview of implementation plans with 1-tap "Proceed with Plan", a sliding review drawer for custom feedback, and a "Reply Later / Snooze" option.
- 🖼️ **Image & Media Attachments** — Added `POST /api/upload-image` endpoint with mobile file picker and drag-and-drop support for sending screenshots and media directly into the desktop chat.
- 🧪 **Developer Mode & Diagnostic Tools** — Isolated diagnostic card in `/admin` with status dot simulators (`Idle`, `Working...`, `Thinking...`, `Reconnecting`, `Cycle`, `Reset`) and action card mock triggers (`Mock Plan Approval`, `Mock Command`, `Mock Question`). Conditionally exposes a discrete "Developer Tools" menu in the mobile chat when active (`localStorage.omni_dev_mode` or `?dev=1`).
- 🗜️ **Ultra-Compact Header Mode** — Added a toggleable compact header mode option for smaller mobile viewports.
- 🧪 **Expanded Unit Test Suite** — Added Vitest unit test suites (`send-lock.test.js`, `action-decision.test.js`, `upload-audio.test.js`, `mobile-viewport.test.js`, `upload-media.test.js`), bringing total coverage to 13 files and 102/102 passing tests.

### Changed
- 🛑 **Better Explicit STOP Button** — Enhanced the active STOP button with an explicit, sober crimson satin finish and gentle ambient breathing pulse (`@keyframes stop-pulse-sober`) when the agent is actively generating, providing immediate visual feedback without harsh glare.
- 🔔 **LIVE Badge & Agent Status** — Improved the LIVE status badge to dynamically reflect real-time Antigravity connection and agent activity (Idle, Working, Thinking) with interactive toast details on tap.
- 📱 **Mobile Viewport & Dynamic Island Optimization** — Hardened virtual keyboard behavior via `interactive-widget=resizes-content` and visual viewport listeners (`window.visualViewport`), with full safe-area inset adaptation for notches and Dynamic Islands.
- ⚡ **PWA Cache Strategy** — Bumped Service Worker shell cache to `omni-antigravity-shell-v9` with Network-First strategy for core CSS/JS assets.

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Option Selection Cycling & Animation Replays** — Fixed rapid option switching jitter by deduplicating `<input>` synthetic events and locking active user selection against stale snapshots.
- 🐛 **PWA Missing Icons** — Fixed missing or unrendered PWA app icons by adding `<link rel="icon">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`, and caching both standard and maskable SVG icons in the service worker shell.
- 🐛 **Activity End Detection & STOP Button Deactivation** — Fixed a regression where past-tense step summaries (`"Worked for 3 minutes"`, `"Completed"`) caused `isGenerating` to remain `true` indefinitely. Active generation is now strictly bound to live IDE markers (`cancelBtn`, Preact `isRunning`, active spinner), deactivating the STOP button immediately upon turn completion.
- 🐛 **False-Alarm Termination Alerts** — Eliminated spurious "Agent Terminated or Blocked!" toasts caused by substring matching on chat history. Error detection now strictly targets live DOM error banners and notifications (`[data-testid="error-banner"]`, `.notification-toast-error`).
- 🐛 **Duplicate Action Card Re-Prompting** — Implemented an acted-action suppression set (`actedActionIds`) preventing already answered plans or commands from blinking or re-appearing.

### Security
- 🔒 **Gated Dev Mock Endpoints** — Guarded `/api/action/mock` and `/api/status/mock` behind `getDevMocksEnabled()` (`ENABLE_DEV_MOCKS`), automatically disabling mock routes in production (returning HTTP 403 Forbidden).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Bug Fix:** Action buttons and modal dialogs (like "Allow in Workspace" or terminal permissions) that exist outside the main chat container are now correctly captured and rendered in the Omnichat remote view (#16, #17).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Security
- 🔒 **Content Security Policy (CSP)** — Strict `script-src 'self'` meta-tag applied to all 4 HTML pages (`index.html`, `login.html`, `admin.html`, `minimal.html`). CSP also enforced via Express HTTP header for defense-in-depth. Prevents XSS via injected snapshot HTML.
- 🔒 **Zero-inline enforcement** — Extracted all remaining inline scripts to external files: `theme-bootstrap.js` (theme init from 3 pages), `login.js` (login logic from `login.html`). Zero `<script>` tags with inline content remain.

### Added
- 🎯 **Leaf-node isolation** — `clickElement()` now filters for inner-most matching DOM nodes, preventing clicks from landing on parent containers instead of the actual interactive element (the "Nested DOM Trap").
- 🎯 **Occurrence index tracking** — Snapshot enrichment adds `data-omni-idx/text/total` attributes to interactive elements. Mobile remote-click sends occurrence index for deterministic targeting of duplicate elements like multiple "Run" or "Thought for Xs" buttons.
- 🔌 **Pinggy tunnel support** — New `scripts/pinggy-tunnel.js` module with `PinggyTunnelManager` class. SSH-based tunneling with zero binary dependencies. Supports ephemeral and token-based persistent subdomains. Configurable via `TUNNEL_PROVIDER=pinggy` and `PINGGY_TOKEN`.
- 🔌 **Multi-tunnel management** — Refactored tunnel system from single `tunnelManager` to `tunnelManagers` map supporting Cloudflare and Pinggy simultaneously with automatic stop-other-on-start logic.
- 📖 **Design Philosophy** — New `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` (195 lines) documenting 10 core principles: Robustness Over Precision, Zero-Impact Mirroring, Visual Parity, Security-First Architecture, Mobile-First Workspace, Modular Architecture, AI-Augmented Operations, Observability as Feature, Graceful Degradation, and Notification-Driven Awareness.
- 🚀 **npm script** — Added `start:web:pinggy` convenience script for one-command Pinggy tunnel launch.

### Changed
- 🔧 **Launcher refactor** — `launcher.js` now supports `--provider` flag and cascading tunnel fallback order (preferred → cloudflare → pinggy → ngrok). Uses native `http`/`https` modules instead of `fetch` for self-signed cert compatibility.
- 🔧 **Admin UI** — Tunnel panel now shows provider selector dropdown (Cloudflare/Pinggy) instead of hardcoded Cloudflare-only button.
- 🔧 **`/js/login.js` public path** — Added to auth middleware whitelist so unauthenticated users can load the login page correctly under CSP.


### Fixed
- 🐛 **WORKSPACE_ROOT injection** — Fixed ESM import hoisting bug that ignored `.env` config variables (Issue #10).
- 🐛 **Mobile UI Blurry Modal** — Repaired a WebKit rendering bug on iOS Safari causing blurred modals via dedicated `::before` pseudo-element (Issue #11).
- 🐛 **Mobile Input Layout** — Mitigated iOS Safari dynamic address bar layout shifts pushing chat input off-screen using `100dvh` (Issue #12).

### Documentation
- 📖 **Task synchronization** — Updated 7 task tracking documents (TASK-06 to TASK-12) to reflect the 100% verified implementation completion.

- 📊 **Session analytics** — Added in-memory session stats, `/api/stats`, a mobile Stats panel, and Telegram stats summaries for messages, approvals, errors, quota warnings, and screen activity.
- 📈 **Model quota service** — Added real local language-server quota discovery, `/api/quota`, automatic alerting, Telegram `/quota`, and a mobile limits summary.
- 💬 **Assist workspace tab** — Added supervisor-backed assist chat history, `/api/assist/*` endpoints, contextual action buttons, and markdown rendering in the mobile workspace.
- 🖼️ **Screenshot timeline** — Added persistent captures in `data/screenshots/`, `/api/timeline*` routes, background change-aware capture scheduling, cleanup, and a dedicated mobile Timeline panel.
- 🧪 **Vitest suite** — Added unit tests for config, hash, network, supervisor, Telegram, session stats, quota, and screenshot timeline, with coverage tooling and `test:unit` scripts.
- 🪟 **Windows & WSL2 Integration** — Added PowerShell context menu scripts (`Start-OmniChat.ps1`, `Start-OmniChat-Ngrok.ps1`) for seamless 1-click execution in WSL2 environments directly from the native Windows File Explorer.

### Changed

- 🤖 **AI Supervisor transport** — Replaced the Ollama-specific supervisor transport with an OmniRoute OpenAI-compatible integration (`/v1/chat/completions`) plus `OMNIROUTE_SUPERVISOR_*` environment variables.
- ⚙️ **Customizable CDP Ports** — Added `CDP_PORTS` environment variable support in `.env` for configurable remote debugging port ranges.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- 🤖 **Phase 2: Remote Autonomy (Human-in-the-loop)** — The mobile interface now detects when the LLM halts to await user permission (e.g. CLI operations). It displays a priority alert modal with 1-tap "Accept" or "Reject" actions directly from the smartphone.
- 📱 **Telegram Bot Integration** — Embedded native push notification alerts via Telegram. The system automatically messages the linked smartphone when critical events arise, such as "Agent Blocks/Quotas", unhandled "Pending Approvals", or "Task Completed Successfully".
- 🔌 **Action Interaction API** — Added `/api/interact-action` endpoint on the server side to deterministically trigger DOM elements corresponding to UI permissions on the Antigravity desktop client.
